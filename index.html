    <h1>Hey! I'm <span>Pluk Zwaal</span>.</h1>
    <p>
    Hey, I’m <strong>Pluk</strong>, 20 years old and currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.  
    Before that, I completed a 3-year vocational program in Software Development, which sparked my passion for web development.<br><br>
    
    I’m eager to deepen my skills in building sleek, fast, and minimal websites that prioritize <u>user experience</u>.  
    Web development isn’t just what I study — it’s what drives me.<br><br>
    
    When I’m not coding, you’ll find me at the gym almost every day, clearing my head and pushing my limits.  
    I also work at <strong>Jumbo</strong>, the best supermarket in the Netherlands.  
    On top of that, I’m teaching myself Chinese — because why not? <em>为什么不呢?</em><br><br>
    
    I’m not the fastest learner, but I’m a hard worker who keeps going no matter what.  
    My goal is to build websites I can truly be proud of and keep improving every day.<br><br>
    
    Feel free to check out my GitHub below — I’m always building something exciting. Maybe we can build something together!
